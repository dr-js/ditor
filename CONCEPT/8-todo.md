## TODO: data store format
consider which is better, text or binary:
- text is not that readable, a little bigger, and parsing a little slower, but has clear delimiter, easier inspect if really needed 
- should compatible for git to support

## TODO: keyword/syntax range
no OO support, discourage it,
and consider just ban `class`, `this`, `self`, or `@`
